# URDF Skill

Generated robot-description tools for coding agents.

The URDF skill operates on explicit Python sources that define `gen_urdf()`. It does not assume a project root or directory layout, so it can be used inside this harness, in the standalone [urdf-skill](https://github.com/earthtojake/urdf-skill) repo, or in another project that provides the required Python environment.

## What It Can Do

- Regenerate `.urdf` outputs from Python `gen_urdf()` sources.
- Validate URDF XML with `yourdfpy`.
- Check link names, joint names, parent/child references, rooted tree structure, and joint limits.
- Validate visual mesh filenames and supported mesh references.
- Print compact robot, link, and joint summaries after regeneration.
- Keep URDF generation separate from STEP, STL, GLB/topology, and DXF generation.

## Commands

Run commands from the project that owns the target files:

```bash
python <urdf-skill>/scripts/gen_urdf path/to/robot.py
python <urdf-skill>/scripts/gen_urdf path/to/robot.py --summary
```

Install the skill runtime dependencies from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) when the active Python environment does not already provide them.

If URDF mesh references depend on changed CAD geometry, regenerate those CAD or STL outputs separately with the CAD skill.

## Project Harness

The [text-to-cad harness](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad) is a convenient way to manage projects that use this skill. It provides a `models/` layout, a local viewer, prompt-reference UX, and root setup commands that install the bundled skill dependencies.

For agent-facing workflow rules, use [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).
