# ⚙ CAD Skill ⚙

CAD workflows to programatically generate STEP/STL/3MF/DXF/GLB files; regenerate, inspect, validate, snapshot, resolve @cad refs, and hand off CAD Explorer links.

</div>

The CAD skill generates, regenerates, inspects, validates, snapshots, and hands off CAD models for local coding-agent workflows. It is the CAD engine inside the [text-to-cad harness](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad) and can also be used standalone in any project with the required Python runtime.

The skill operates on explicit source files and imported STEP/STP files. It does not assume a project root or directory layout; relative targets are resolved from the directory where you run the command.

## ✨ Features

- **Generate** - Create source-controlled CAD models from Python generator files.
- **Export** - Produce STEP, STL, 3MF, DXF, GLB, and topology artifacts from generated or imported CAD targets.
- **Browse** - Inspect generated geometry with the bundled CAD Explorer web app.
- **Reference** - Copy and resolve stable `@cad[...]` handles for precise follow-up edits.
- **Review** - Render quick snapshots and deterministic summaries during an iteration loop.
- **Reproduce** - Edit source or imported STEP/STP files first, then regenerate explicit targets.
- **Local** - Run the skill and CAD Explorer locally with no hosted backend.

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Describe** - Ask your coding agent for the part, assembly, fixture, mechanism, or CAD edit you want.
2. **Edit** - Update the owning Python generator or imported STEP/STP source file.
3. **Regenerate** - Run the explicit STEP, STL, 3MF, DXF, GLB, or topology target.
4. **Inspect** - Open CAD Explorer or render snapshots to review the result.
5. **Reference** - Use `@cad[...]` handles when a follow-up prompt depends on specific faces, edges, corners, bodies, or occurrences.
6. **Commit** - Save source and generated artifacts together once the model is ready.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Inside the text-to-cad harness, this bundled skill lives at `.agents/skills/cad`. In a standalone install, replace `.agents/skills/cad` with the path to the skill checkout.

The demo GIF is tracked with Git LFS but skipped by default so normal clones stay small. To hydrate it locally in the standalone skill repo:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="assets/*.gif" --exclude=""
```

Install Python CAD dependencies:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
./.venv/bin/pip install -r .agents/skills/cad/requirements.txt
```

Install CAD Explorer dependencies:

```bash
npm --prefix .agents/skills/cad/explorer install
```

Run CAD Explorer from the project directory you want to scan:

```bash
npm --prefix .agents/skills/cad/explorer run dev:ensure
```

Then open [http://localhost:4178](http://localhost:4178).

## 🧰 Core Commands

Run commands from the project that owns the target files:

```bash
python <cad-skill>/scripts/gen_step_part/cli.py path/to/part.py
python <cad-skill>/scripts/gen_step_assembly/cli.py path/to/assembly.py --summary
python <cad-skill>/scripts/gen_dxf/cli.py path/to/drawing.py
python <cad-skill>/scripts/cadref/cli.py inspect '@cad[path/to/entry]' --json
python <cad-skill>/scripts/snapshot/cli.py path/to/.part.step/model.glb --view isometric --out /tmp/cad-review.png
```

The command interfaces are target-explicit. Generation tools write and overwrite their configured outputs, but they do not delete stale outputs when paths change.

## 🧭 Project Harness

The text-to-cad harness is intentionally thin: it gives a local project a repo, setup commands, project notes, and bundled skills. This CAD skill owns the reusable CAD workflow, command references, prompt-reference grammar, CAD Explorer app, and validation tooling.

Keep project inventory, durable quirks, and preferred rebuild roots in project-local notes such as `PROJECT.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Keep reusable CAD workflow rules in this skill.
